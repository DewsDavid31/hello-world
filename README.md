# hello-world
Hello!, I am David Dews a Sophomore of MSU Denver, looking to make some fancy things!
This is a simple Hello World program I am using to test out github for the first time!
This program might require to be run using:
javaac HelloWorld.java

in the terminal, or to be copy-pasted into a Java IDE.
